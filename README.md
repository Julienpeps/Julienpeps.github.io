## Introduction

I am a programming languages self-learner and i'm currently learning web development with JavaScript and HTML. The style will come later ;)

## Random choice picker

This is my first small project in JS.

Just choose how many choices you want to randomize, type in your choices and check the result!

## Tip calculator

This project was inspired by [Skillcrush](https://skillcrush.com/blog/projects-you-can-do-with-javascript/)

Enter the bill amount, select the rating and type in the number of persons.
